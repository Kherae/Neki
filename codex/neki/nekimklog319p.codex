"The twins are -incredible- learners.

From the moment they were out of their pods, they've been completely overwhelming us with their insatiable curiosity and capacity to learn. They figured rudimentary speech out within a day of listening to us talk, and within just weeks could already comprehend complex topics that normally take years of studies to get even a basic grasp on!

I am both extremely excited about and utterly terrified of their potential."
