"Long live Big Ape!

Preliminary analysis of the data shows that the Human research seems to have been focused entirely on the introduction of benign physiological traits of a lesser species into their own genome; purpose unclear.

We believe looking into the original goals of the research is vital, as investing in such resource-intensive but otherwise pointless science without good reason would have been highly illogical, even for Humans.  ^cyan;>>^white;",

"I will de-classify parts of the data in order to consult civillian Earth experts on the matter. Hopefully, this whould yield us a better understanding of what this research was meant to achieve, and a better perspective from which to approach it.

Glory to the Miniknog!"
