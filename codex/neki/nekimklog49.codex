"Our first progress report sure sent beards in a flurry. Being presented what they ultimately deemed to be mere \"pointy-eared pet humans\" must've been so utterly disappointing to a committee consisting of a glorified bunch of overly-hyped, scientifically-inept officers.

I managed to negotiate in favor of extending the project however, but at the cost of significantly scaling the team down and imposing practically impossible deadlines for achieving presentable results.  ^cyan;>>^white;",

"Despite not everybody seeing eye-to-eye with me, I am convinced that pursuing this research is paramount. We are on the verge of what could well be the most significant breakthrough since the research into the undesired side-effects of the Vestigi-Evo Process began!

...Glory to the Miniknog, I guess."
