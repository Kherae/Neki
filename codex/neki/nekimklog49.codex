"Our first progress report sure sent some beards in a flurry. The notion of what the committee deemed to be mere \"pointy-eared pet Humans\" being the only thing we had to show for it must've felt so utterly disappointing to a glorified bunch of overly-hyped, scientifically-inept officers.

I managed to negotiate in favor of extending the project however, but at the cost of significantly scaling the team down and imposing practically impossible deadlines for achieving presentable results.  ^cyan;>>^white;",

"Despite not everybody seeing eye-to-eye with me, I still firmly believe that continuing this research is paramount. We are on the verge of what could well be the most significant breakthrough since the research into alleviating the undesired side-effects of the Vestigi-Evo Process began!

..glory to the Miniknog!"
