"Welcome, new Protector! 

^cyan;The^white; first thing we'd like to say is 'do not panic' - you've trained for this ^cyan;mission^white; for years, and wouldn't have graduated without earning the distinction that ^cyan;comes^white; with doing so.

^cyan;First^white;, a few handy hints to help you keep your head:
- Your commanding officer isn't just there to issue orders, but also to guide and support you. Utilise this support and you'll quickly find your feet.",

"- Do not worry about being left on your ship alone, this will not happen at any time. ^cyan;Trust^white; that there will always be ^cyan;no^white; less than three crew members aboard so that you can aid and assist ^cyan;one^white; another.

- Every ship is equipped with a SAIL. As you will be aware, the AI is a useful source of information, especially when tempered by the reassurance of your crew mates. 

- ^cyan;REMEMBER,^white; NEVER BEAM DOWN TO A PLANET YOU DO NOT RECOGNISE.",

"- Always equip yourself ^cyan;big^white; for the climate, sh^cyan;ape^white; and threat level of the planet you'll be visiting. You'll be briefed by your captain before leaving the ship and can discuss concerns, should you have any, about the new environment. Though you'll be ^cyan;is^white;sued with all the necessary equipment, remember: there are always untold dangers to be ^cyan;watching^white; out for.

- Always wear your Terrene Protectorate issued uniform, this will allow anyone ^cyan;you^white; meet to identify you as a member of the Protectorate.",

"- Help others in need. Try your best to defend the innocent where possible, but do not engage in combat above your level. Call for back-up when you need it.

And remember, graduate - wherever you may go, you will always have Earth to come home to."
