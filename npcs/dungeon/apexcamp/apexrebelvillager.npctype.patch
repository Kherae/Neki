			"The Miniknog have weird taste... hmm? Oh, I was talking about the way you look.",
			"Was sending one of YOU supposed to seem less suspicious? We know what you are.",
			"Your behavior seems unusual for a Neki.. is something wrong with your collar?",
			"Are you here to take part in the rebellion, Neki? We could help one another.",
			"Don't mind some here not trusting you. The plan is on a need-to-know basis.",
			"The only way I'd feel safe around you, is if you were back in your pod.",
			"You're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid to have come here.",
			"Were you the product of any other research, I might've been impressed.",
			"Not gonna lie, they've made you look almost innocent enough to trust.",
			"No matter your intentions, you're still a product of the oppressors.",
			"Is it true that some of you aren't all that loyal to your masters?",
			"I wonder if you're aware of the purpose your kind was created for.",
			"You being here means that everything's going according to plan.",

			"I don't think I'll ever be able to fully trust you, Neki.",
			"You're here for either espionage or sabotage, I know it!",
			"What's your name? <entityname>? Isn't that a pet's name?",
			"I could almost fall for that innocent look, I'll admit.",
			"You've got one of those MCCs on you, you poor thing...",
			"How is no-one else around alarmed by your presence?!",
			"Is there any good left in you, Neki? Was there ever?",
			"Why is one of you just walking freely around here?!",
			"It appears that the scientist's crazy plan worked!",
			"How does it feel, being someone's artificial pet?",
			"I wonder what Lana would have to say about you.",
			"We'll need you soon, Neki. Don't let us down.",
			"Why'd they make you this fluffy, I wonder.",
			"Seeing you brings back painful memories.",
			"Whose side are you REALLY on, Neki?"
