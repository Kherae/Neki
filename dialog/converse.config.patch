			"We're willing to learn more about your kind, but our curiosity is in no way a weakness.",
			"Humans often have a cat on their ship. Are you perhaps a result of forbidden curiosity?",
			"I don't believe I've seen your kind depicted in any the great masters' works, how odd.",
			"We Hylotl make many protein-rich dishes, but prefer to stay off the menu ourselves.",
			"How are you this similar to Humans? And did Earth's demise impact you as greatly?",
			"Do you have a revered authority figure? I can't imagine what they must be like.",

			"Anyone can achieve inner peace, but it may be harder for some than others.",
			"The danger you pose is artfully disguised by your captivating appearance.",
			"Your gaze seems wild and feral, yet your actions seem almost sentient.",
			"I imagine it cannot be easy to be feared and despised by so many...",
			"Could you recommend any Neki poetry? If such a thing even exists.",
			"What were the Miniknog thinking, creating creatures like you..?",
			"Your tail could be good for swimming, if it had any fins on it.",

		// Vanilla
			"I've had nightmares about your kind! But I'll be nice, I know it's not your fault.",
			"Predator and prey are equal parts of nature - this is how balance is maintained.",
			"In all the books in our libraries, I have never read about someone like you.",
			"You look like you could use a quiet minute to compose yourself.",
			"You may seem civilised but I'm still uneasy around your kind...",
			"We Hylotl believe in tolerance, and that extends to your kind.",
			"Isn't it strange how different the lives of two beings can be?",
			"You look like you've been dragged through a bush backwards.",
			"Your fur is a completely foreign concept to us Hylotl.",
			"Before you get any ideas, I don't taste very nice!",

		// Vanilla Neutral
			"Value your master, but also your servants. No building can stand without a solid foundation.",
			"If you need to calm your mind, try picturing the play of sunlight on a cerulean sea.",
			"Moonlight through water is a beautiful sight, shifting shafts of iridescent light.",
			"Do you want to know a secret? Well I'm afraid I can't tell you, it's confidential.",
			"Please don't tell the other Hylotl, but I must confess, I'm not much of a reader.",
			"It's hard to compare the beauty of nature with the beauty of the crafted object.",
			"It was a beautiful day yesterday. We can only hope tomorrow will be the same.",
			"Sometimes I crave the peace that comes from living a hermitic life.",
			"While I abhor violence, I still deeply respect our warriors.",
			"The longer the journey the more deserved the destination.",
			"While things must be practical, never undervalue beauty.",
			"The last page of my book is missing! What will I do!?",
			"It's foolish to crave power. Power destroys.",
			"Life without beauty is but empty drudgery.",
			"It is important to remain humble, I find.",
