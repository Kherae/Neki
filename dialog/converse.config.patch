			"What were the Miniknog thinking, creating creatures like you..?",
			"Your gaze seems wild and feral, yet your actions seem almost sentient.",
			"The danger you pose is artfully disguised by your captivating appearance.",
			"Do you know much of the origin of your kind? Ours spans back generations...",
			"Your fur must be arduous to keep tidy.. is that why you look the way you do?",
			"Do you have a revered authority figure? I can't imagine what they must be like.",
			"We Hylotl make many protein-rich dishes, but prefer to stay off the menu ourselves.",
			"Humans often have a cat on their ship. Are you perhaps a result of forbidden curiosity?",
			"I've heard felines often have a disdain for water, does your kind suffer the same aversion?",
			"You look like you possess valuable information, as well as a keen interest in what I taste like.",
			"Your kind has such potential for artistry, but your instincts seem overwhelmingly destructive.",

			"Your complexion screams efficiency, yet some features seem almost redundant.",
			"Those are exceptionally sharp claws you have there.. please keep them away.",
			"When the masters depicted felines, I doubt you were what they had in mind.",
			"Anyone can achieve inner peace, but it may be harder for some than others.",
			"I imagine it cannot be easy to be feared and despised by so many...",
			"Could you recommend any Neki poetry? If such a thing even exists.",
			"Your tail could be good for swimming, if it had any fins on it.",
			"I don't need three eyes to see your intentions. Begone, Neki.",
			"Do you see your hunts as a form of art?",

		// Vanilla-ish
			"Settle yourself down, furry one.",
			"Meeting a Neki is a little nerve-racking.",
			"As long as you're not here to eat me, I could tolerate you.",
			"Neki are so chaotic and violent... this is not in the Hylotl nature.",
			"I'll try to remain civil with you, but fear makes it difficult.",
			"I collect books, but I don't have any written by the Neki.",
			"Your cold-blooded stare unsettles me.",

		// Vanilla
			"Your fur makes me sneeze.",

			"Do you have fleas? I'm allergic to insect bites.",
			"Before you get any ideas, I don't taste very nice!",
			"Your fur is a completely foreign concept to us Hylotl.",
			"Isn't it strange how different the lives of two beings can be?",
			"You look like you could use a quiet minute to compose yourself.",
			"You may seem civilised but I'm still uneasy around your kind...",
			"In all the books in our libraries, I have never read about someone like you.",
			"I've had nightmares about your kind! But I'll be nice, I know it's not your fault.",
			"Predator and prey are equal parts of nature - this is how balance is maintained.",
			"We Hylotl believe in tolerance, and that extends to your kind.",

			"It is important to remain humble, I find.",
			"It's foolish to crave power. Power destroys.",
			"The last page of my book is missing! What will I do!?",
			"While things must be practical, never undervalue beauty.",
			"While I abhor violence, I still deeply respect our warriors.",
			"Sometimes I crave the peace that comes from living a hermitic life.",
			"It was a beautiful day yesterday. We can only hope tomorrow will be the same.",
			"Do you want to know a secret? Well I'm afraid I can't tell you, it's confidential.",
			"If you need to calm your mind, try picturing the play of sunlight on a cerulean sea.",
			"Value your master, but also your servants. No building can stand without a solid foundation.",
			"Moonlight through water is a beautiful sight, shifting shafts of iridescent light.",
			"Please don't tell the other Hylotl, but I must confess, I'm not much of a reader.",
			"It's hard to compare the beauty of nature with the beauty of the crafted object.",
			"The longer the journey the more deserved the destination.",
			"Life without beauty is but empty drudgery.",
			"I will fight anyone who rejects pacifism."
